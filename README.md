# NLP Twitter Bot

This natural language processing bot inhales all previous tweets from someone, then based on their vocabulary can build statements that you'd expect them to make.

Included are tweets from Donald Trump and Bernie Sanders.  Initially their responses make no sense at all, after several hundred epochs they use broken english, and 
after several hundred more they will produce realistic statements based on what you'd expect out of their twitter feeds.
